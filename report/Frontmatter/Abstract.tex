\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
Recent advances in computer vision research have made it possible to produce photo-realistic 3D volumetric reconstructions of complex scenes based on datasets of 2D images - this includes the ability to manipulate specific objects in these scenes. Significant progress has also been made in the field of vision-language models, which have effectively been able to capture many different semantic relationships between text captions and image data, and have paved the way for text-based editing frameworks. This project seeks to bridge the gap between these two areas of research, and proposes a novel method which can perform manipulations of objects in photo-realistic 3D scenes that are semantically consistent with a given text prompt.
