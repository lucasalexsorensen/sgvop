# sgvop
Code for my master's thesis on Semantically Guided Volumetric Object Placement. The code mostly serves the purpose of producing exploratory plots that are included in the report.

# Structure
* _notebooks_
    * Main directory for notebooks. These basically all non-NeRF related code
    * 2D optimization: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lucasalexsorensen/sgvop/blob/master/notebooks/2D_optimization.ipynb)
    * 2D semantic: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lucasalexsorensen/sgvop/blob/master/notebooks/2D_semantic.ipynb) (use Colab Pro to avoid OOM)
    * 3D semantic: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lucasalexsorensen/sgvop/blob/master/notebooks/3D_semantic.ipynb) (use Colab Pro to avoid OOM)
    * Geometry: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lucasalexsorensen/sgvop/blob/master/notebooks/Geometry.ipynb)

* _notebooks/images_
    * The raw images that were used for the 2D experiments
    
* _notebooks/meshes_
    * The meshes/textures that were used for the 3D experiments

* _report_
    * LaTeX files and output PDF for the final report
